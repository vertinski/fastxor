def xor64(data1: bytes, data2: bytes) -> bytes:
    """
    Perform fast 64-bit XOR operation on two bytes objects.

    This function provides maximum performance by processing 8 bytes at a time
    using native 64-bit integer operations. Both input objects must have
    identical lengths that are multiples of 8 bytes.

    Args:
        data1: First bytes object to XOR. Must be multiple of 8 bytes.
        data2: Second bytes object to XOR. Must be same length as data1.

    Returns:
        XOR result of data1 ^ data2 as bytes object.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs have different lengths, are less than 8 bytes,
                   or length is not a multiple of 8 bytes.
        MemoryError: If memory allocation fails.
        RuntimeError: If result bytes object creation fails.

    Example:
        >>> import fastxor
        >>> data1 = b'12345678' * 16  # 128 bytes
        >>> data2 = b'abcdefgh' * 16  # 128 bytes
        >>> result = fastxor.xor64(data1, data2)
        >>> len(result)
        128

    Note:
        For maximum performance, ensure your data size is a multiple of 8 bytes.
        This function is optimized for bulk data processing and cryptographic
        operations where alignment guarantees can be made.

    Performance:
        Processes 8 bytes per operation using native 64-bit CPU instructions.
        Typical speedup: 10-20x over byte-wise Python operations.

def xor(data1: bytes, data2: bytes) -> bytes:
    """
    Flexible XOR operation using 64-bit optimization where possible.

    This function automatically uses 64-bit operations for aligned portions
    of the data and falls back to byte-wise operations for any remainder.
    It handles any size data without alignment restrictions.

    Args:
        data1: First bytes object to XOR. Can be any size.
        data2: Second bytes object to XOR. Must be same length as data1.

    Returns:
        XOR result of data1 ^ data2 as bytes object.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If inputs have different lengths.
        MemoryError: If memory allocation fails.
        RuntimeError: If result bytes object creation fails.

    Example:
        >>> import fastxor
        >>> data1 = b'Hello, World!'  # 13 bytes
        >>> data2 = b'Secret Key123'  # 13 bytes
        >>> result = fastxor.xor(data1, data2)
        >>> len(result)
        13

    Performance:
        - Uses 64-bit operations for first (len(data) // 8) * 8 bytes
        - Uses byte operations for remaining len(data) % 8 bytes
        - Automatically chooses optimal strategy based on data size
        - Typical speedup: 5-15x over byte-wise Python operations

    Note:
        This is the recommended function for most use cases as it handles
        any data size while still providing significant performance benefits.

def get_info() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get detailed information about the fastxor implementation.

    Returns implementation details including word size, alignment requirements,
    version information, and optimization details.

    Returns:
        Implementation information dictionary with keys:
        - 'word_size' (int): Bit size of native integer operations (64)
        - 'alignment' (int): Required byte alignment for xor64() (8)
        - 'version' (str): Module version string
        - 'description' (str): Brief description of capabilities

"""
FastXOR - High-Performance XOR Operations

A Python C extension module providing ultra-fast XOR operations optimized
for 64-bit architectures. This module is designed for high-throughput
applications such as cryptography, data processing, and stream ciphers.

Key Features:
  • Native 64-bit XOR operations for maximum performance
  • Automatic fallback for non-aligned data
  • Comprehensive error handling and validation
  • Memory-efficient processing
  • Thread-safe operations

Functions:
  xor64(data1, data2)  - Fast XOR requiring 8-byte alignment
  xor(data1, data2)    - Flexible XOR handling any size data
  get_info()           - Implementation details and capabilities

Constants:
  WORD_SIZE           - Native word size in bits (64)
  MIN_SIZE            - Minimum size for xor64() function (8 bytes)

Performance:
  Typical speedups of 5-20x over pure Python implementations,
  depending on data size and alignment. Best performance achieved
  with data sizes that are multiples of 8 bytes.

Example Usage:
  >>> import fastxor
  >>> data1 = b'Hello World!!!!!'  # 16 bytes
  >>> data2 = b'Secret Key 12345'  # 16 bytes
  >>> result = fastxor.xor64(data1, data2)
  >>> # Use xor() for any size data
  >>> result = fastxor.xor(b'Any size', b'data here')

Thread Safety:
  All functions are thread-safe and can be called concurrently
  from multiple threads without synchronization.

Memory Usage:
  Functions allocate temporary memory equal to input size.
  Memory is automatically freed on function return.
